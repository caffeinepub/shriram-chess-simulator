  "summary": "Diff implements an in-board pawn promotion overlay UI, exposes/uses pending promotion state in the game hook (blocking interaction until resolved), adds AI auto-promotion behavior, and updates chess rules for pawn attack detection plus broader rules/draw validation. Diff also includes several unrelated UI/AI/3D rendering enhancements not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "description": "Added/changed AI evaluation feature (evaluationToWinProbability logistic mapping) not requested.",
