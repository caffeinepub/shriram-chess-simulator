  "summary": "REQ-18 appears implemented by updating SettingsPanel layout to a single non-wrapping horizontal flex row for the three selects while keeping Player Name. REQ-19/REQ-20 appear addressed in pieces3d.tsx via redesigned knight geometry and a light-gray top accent for black pieces. However, the diff suggests additional 3D geometry changes for non-knight pieces (e.g., rook towers), which were not requested and may conflict with the requirement to keep other piece types unchanged aside from color/material accents.",

      "description": "Apparent redesign/geometry changes to non-knight 3D pieces (e.g., rook described as having a \"square top with 4 corner towers\" and pawn/rook geometries shown), beyond the requested black top-surface color/material treatment.",
      "reason": "REQ-19 specifies redesigning/replacing only the 3D Knight geometry and that all other piece types remain unchanged; REQ-20 calls for a purely material/color treatment (no redesign) to improve black piece top-view contrast. The diff text indicates structural/shape changes for other pieces, not just color changes.",
